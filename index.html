<h2>&#10024; About Emilie Brinker &#10024;</h2>

<p>My name is Emilie Brinker, and I'm a student at <abbr title="University of Cincinati">UC</abbr> Blue Ash. My goal is to get an associates degree in Applied Media Communications. I coded this website for my Web Design class.</p>

<p>I like reading and writing fictional stories, and I'm interested in becoming a writer for movies and TV shows. I'm also interested in animation, even though I think my artstyle can still improve, and I'd like to get a career in 2D animation if not in writing.</p>
